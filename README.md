# What would it take for Australia to have been powered by 100% solar energy in 2019?

The aim of this project is to investigate the total energy demand for Australia (Dec/18 - Dec-19). By determining the trends in energy demand, I will show:

1. The necessary amount of storage needed to sufficiently store enough energy for off peak times to power the country. This will take into account a reasonable buffer capacity to allow for any days when energy production is abnormally low such as below average wind or sunlight.

2. Determine the total energy production capactity needed. This will need to allow enough excess power to charge the storage system during the day to be release that at night.
